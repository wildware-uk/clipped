//! The `serve` subcommand: the recorder as a service the desktop application
//! drives.
//!
//! `record` is one recording and then the process exits. `serve` is the shape
//! the recorder actually runs in — started at login, outliving every window the
//! user opens, and told what to do over the protocol in `clipped-ipc`
//! ([ADR 0002](../../../docs/adr/0002-separate-recorder-process.md),
//! `docs/ipc.md`).
//!
//! This module is the *application* behind that protocol. `clipped-ipc` owns
//! the transport, the framing, the handshake and the dispatch; what is here is
//! the part that knows what a recording is: [`RecorderService`] answers the
//! commands, and [`RecordingState`] owns the one recording this process will
//! run at a time and the thread it runs on.
//!
//! # What it can actually do
//!
//! Start a recording, stop one, and say what it is doing — the same recording
//! `record` makes, through the same `clipped-session` call, validated by the
//! same code (AGENTS.md section 55). Every other command in the protocol
//! belongs to a subsystem that is not built, and `clipped-ipc` refuses those
//! before they reach this module at all, with the milestone and issue that
//! build them.
//!
//! # Threads
//!
//! ```text
//!  main thread            connection threads         recording thread
//!  ───────────            ──────────────────         ────────────────
//!  accept ──────────────▶ read, dispatch ──────────▶ capture, encode, mux
//!                         write the reply            publish what changed
//!  Ctrl+C: stop the listener, then stop the recording and wait for its file
//! ```
//!
//! A command never runs on the recording thread and the recording never runs on
//! a connection thread. That is not tidiness: `clipped_session::record` blocks
//! for the length of the recording, so answering `get_status` on the thread that
//! started it would mean the UI froze for as long as the recording lasted.
//!
//! # Shutting down
//!
//! Ctrl+C stops the listener and then stops the recording, in that order, and
//! waits for the file to be finalised before the process exits. The recording
//! is the only thing here that must survive its process ending correctly
//! (AGENTS.md section 17); connection threads own nothing and are left to go
//! with the process.
